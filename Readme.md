The algorithms presented in this project are First In First Out and Last In First Out

The Processes executed are 
1. First In First Out Alone
2. Last In First Out Alone
3. First In First Out and Last In First Out Concurrently

The input file is data.json where you can find all the input data.
Data is imported from the data.json file for all the three programs executed. 

psutil, time, json, pandas, numpy and matplotlib are the modules imported for the execution of the programs/processes.

If the input needs to modified and executed, one can modify in the data.json file. 


To execute the First In First Out algorithm, Run the FIFO.py file. One can find the output with user-level and system-level information, and also the bar graph representing the cpu usage, Virtual_memory usage and Hard-drive Usage.

To execute the Last In First Out algorithm, Run the LIFO.py file.

To execute the both the algorithms concurrently, Run the Concurrent_Process.py file.
